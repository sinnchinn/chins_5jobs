// peer reviewer comments: I love the design with the drop downs and the side navbar, great job choices too, the PubMark and UsTwo were both something i had nevere heard and are interesting, i love the way all the info was displayed so its not too much all at once, it was very intuitive and conveyed why she wanted to go to those jobs and what she would need to do to achive those goals.
